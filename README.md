A dark Vim colorscheme with vitaminic colors that promote fruitful programming
and writing
</b>
</p>

## Introduction

Featuring orange, several "fruity" colors, two shades of dark grey, and one
shade of light grey, **vim-vitamin-onec** received its name because (i) the
orange is both a meaningful highlight color and a fruit containing **vitamin**
C, (ii) the dominant grey background has a **onec** color code of `#1c1c1c`, and
(iii) the alliteration in the name makes it more fun to say. Since the
combination of those facts yielded the name "**vim-vitamin-onec**", this
colorscheme offers a vitaminic combination of bright colors and dark greys will
promote "fruitful" programming and writing.

Providing both true-color and 256-color variants, **vim-vitamin-onec** supports
Vim, Neovim, MacVim, and GVim &mdash; although the colorscheme is primarily
developed and tested with Neovim. Even though it should work in other contexts,
the colorscheme best enhances the use of Neovim during the use of the following
languages: CSS, HTML, Java, JavaScript, LaTeX, Markdown, Python, React, and
Shell. Importantly, **vim-vitamin-onec** provides highlight group definitions
for well-known Vim plugins (e.g., [Semshi's](https://github.com/numirias/semshi)
semantic highlighting of Python code).
